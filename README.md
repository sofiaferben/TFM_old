# TFM - Master's Thesis Project

This repository contains the code and resources developed for my Master's Thesis. The project involves the construction and processing of a dataset, followed by model training and evaluation. The focus is on organizing the workflow in a clear and reproducible manner.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset Construction**:  
   - Raw data is collected and stored under `data/raw/`.
   - Processing steps are implemented via numbered scripts or notebooks in `code/` to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
   - The cleaned and split dataset is stored under `data/clean/`.

2. **Modeling and Evaluation**:  
   - Machine learning models are developed and trained using the processed data.
   - Visualizations (e.g., training curves, confusion matrices) are saved under `figures/`.
   - Evaluation results and metrics are stored under `results/`.

## How to Use

Instructions for setting up the environment, running the code, and reproducing results will be added here as the project progresses.
